APLpy documentation
===================

APLpy (pronounced 'apple pie') is a python module that makes it easy to
interactively produce publication-quality plots of astronomical images in FITS
format. For example, it can be used to:

* Interactively or non-interactively produce publication-quality plots;
* Show grayscale, colorscale, and 3-color RGB images;
* Overlay any number of contour and marker sets;
* Dynamically hide, show, and remove contour and marker layers;
* Overlay coordinate grids;
* Customize the appearance of labels and ticks;
* Use LaTeX to typeset labels;
* Pan, zoom, and save any view as a full publication-quality plot;
* Save plots as EPS, PS, PDF, SVG, or PNG files;

APLpy is still in beta development, so you may encounter bugs and/or
missing features. If this is the case, please let us know either by emailing
us at astropython@gmail.com, or by leaving a bug report or feature request in
the forums at http://apps.sourceforge.net/phpbb/aplpy
